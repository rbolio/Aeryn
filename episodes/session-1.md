(arrived late)

We went to bar looking for <insert weird woman's name here>, because we need information only she can provide. We intend to kill her.

We find her at the second floor of a pub. She is gambling. and cheating.

She says she will give us the information for free (and us not killing her) if we can protect her from some pirate that wants her dead.

When night falls, we can hear music in the tabern comming from the walls. Something about Hellriders. Also, the song "changed" from what it usually is

Our bard (Marco) layed a woman for information. 

We wait overnight while the pirate comes for the lady.

we finished with possibility of battle.
