His mother should have thrown him away and kept the stork

There's nothing wrong with you that reincarnation won't cure.

You are proof that the gods have a sense of humor

I like the way you try

It is imposible to understimate you

Ahhh a hideous fiend! Oh wait no, you're just ugly.

I've recieved more witty banter from zombies!

Ugh what the hell is that all over your face? Oh.. that's just your face.

Your fighting stance looks like an unfolded lawn chair!

Ordinarily people live and learn. You just keep on living.

I’ve seen people like you before, but I had to pay admission.

I can’t believe you’d come out in public with a face like that. Have some decency and wear a mask.

I’m so excited to forget you.
